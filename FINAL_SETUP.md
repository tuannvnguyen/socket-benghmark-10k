   - Node.js environment optimization

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### 1. Complete Setup (Run Once)
```bash
# Install dependencies and optimize system
./quick_setup.sh

# Load optimizations
source .env.benchmark
```

### 2. Start Server
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the server
npm start
```

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
# Terminal 2: Run preset tests
node dist/benchmark.js quick

# Or run specific tests
npm run test:1k    # 1,000 connections
npm run test:5k    # 5,000 connections  
npm run test:10k   # 10,000 connections
```

## 📊 Expected Results for Your Hardware

### Realistic Expectations (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM)
- **✅ 5,000-7,000 concurrent connections**: Very likely achievable
- **🎯 8,000-10,000 concurrent connections**: Achievable with optimization
- **⚠️ 10,000+ concurrent connections**: May hit memory limits

### Performance Targets
- **Connection Success Rate**: >95%
- **Memory per Connection**: 1-2MB (total: 10-20GB for 10K)
- **CPU Usage**: 60-80% for 10K connections
- **Connection Time**: <5 seconds average

### Potential Bottlenecks
1. **Memory (Most Likely)**: 8GB may limit to ~6K-8K connections
2. **CPU**: Should handle 10K connections adequately
3. **Network**: 5Gbps is more than sufficient

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Baseline Testing
```bash
# Start small to verify system works
node dist/benchmark.js run --connections 500 --rate 25
node dist/benchmark.js run --connections 1000 --rate 50
```

### Phase 2: Progressive Load Testing
```bash
# Gradually increase load
node dist/benchmark.js run --connections 2500 --rate 100
node dist/benchmark.js run --connections 5000 --rate 200
```

### Phase 3: Target Testing
```bash
# Go for the goal
node dist/benchmark.js run --connections 7500 --rate 250
node dist/benchmark.js run --connections 10000 --rate 300
```

### Phase 4: Maximum Capacity
```bash
# Find your absolute limit
node dist/benchmark.js run --connections 12500 --rate 400
node dist/benchmark.js run --connections 15000 --rate 500
```

## 📈 Monitoring During Tests

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# Terminal 1: Server
npm start

# Terminal 2: System monitor  
htop

# Terminal 3: Connection count
watch -n 1 'curl -s http://localhost:3000/metrics | grep -o "activeConnections\":[0-9]*"'

# Terminal 4: Run test
npm run test:10k
```

### Performance Metrics Dashboard
Visit `http://localhost:3000/metrics` during tests to see:
- Active connection count
- Memory usage (RSS, heap)
- Total connections processed
- Error rates

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Excellent Performance (Grade A+)
- ✅ 10,000+ concurrent connections
- ✅ >95% connection success rate
- ✅ <5 second average connection time
- ✅ <6GB memory usage
- ✅ <80% CPU usage

### Good Performance (Grade B+)
- ✅ 7,500+ concurrent connections
- ✅ >90% connection success rate
- ✅ <7 second average connection time
- ✅ <7GB memory usage
- ✅ <85% CPU usage

### Needs Optimization (Grade C)
- ⚠️ 5,000+ concurrent connections
- ⚠️ >80% connection success rate
- ⚠️ <10 second average connection time
- ⚠️ Memory swapping occurs
- ⚠️ >90% CPU usage

## 🔧 Optimization Tips

### If Memory is the Bottleneck
```bash
# Reduce per-connection memory usage
# Edit src/server.ts:
maxHttpBufferSize: 64 * 1024,  # Reduce buffer size
pingTimeout: 30000,            # Reduce ping timeout
pingInterval: 15000,           # Reduce ping interval

# Use external session storage
npm install redis connect-redis
```

### If CPU is the Bottleneck
```bash
# Use cluster mode
npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start dist/server.js -i max  # Use all CPU cores

# Optimize event loop
export UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=256
```

### If Connections Fail
```bash
# Increase timeouts
# Edit src/client.ts:
timeout: 20000,  # Increase connection timeout

# Reduce connection rate
node dist/benchmark.js run --connections 10000 --rate 200
```
