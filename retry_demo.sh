echo "ðŸ“‹ Available retry options:"
echo "â€¢ --max-retries: Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3)"
echo "â€¢ --retry-delay: Base delay between retries in ms (default: 1000ms)"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ§ª Example commands with retry configuration:"
echo ""

echo "1. Basic test with default retry settings (3 retries, 1000ms base delay):"
echo "   npm run test:1k"
echo ""

echo "2. Custom retry configuration:"
echo "   node dist/benchmark.js run --connections 500 --max-retries 5 --retry-delay 2000"
echo ""

echo "3. Disable retries (max-retries = 0):"
echo "   node dist/benchmark.js run --connections 100 --max-retries 0"
echo ""

echo "4. Quick test with custom retry settings:"
echo "   node dist/benchmark.js quick --max-retries 5 --retry-delay 1500"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“Š Retry behavior:"
echo "â€¢ Exponential backoff: delay = base_delay * 2^(attempt-1)"
echo "â€¢ Attempt 1: 1000ms delay"
echo "â€¢ Attempt 2: 2000ms delay" 
echo "â€¢ Attempt 3: 4000ms delay"
echo "â€¢ And so on..."
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“ˆ Enhanced reporting includes:"
echo "â€¢ Total retry attempts made"
echo "â€¢ Connections that succeeded after retries"
echo "â€¢ Retry distribution statistics"
echo "â€¢ Detailed error analysis"
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of retry mechanism:"
echo "â€¢ Higher success rates in unstable network conditions"
echo "â€¢ Better resilience against temporary server overload"
echo "â€¢ More realistic simulation of client behavior"
echo "â€¢ Detailed retry analytics for optimization"
echo ""

echo "To run a test with retries now:"
echo "npm run test:1k"
